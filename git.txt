visualizing git + git fundamentals 


git status -> tell what changes you made from prev status
git add (folder_name) -> pick which changes we want in our next version
                            // ''.' -> add all files 
git commit -m -> creates new version; version == commit 
            // '-m' -> attaching msg to the commit 
git log -> to see version history 


git reset (directory_name) -> from stagged to working change 
git checkout -- (file_name) -> reset changes in working area


* completing the version history
